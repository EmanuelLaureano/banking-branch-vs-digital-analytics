# 📌 Project: Retail Banking Customer Value & Risk Analytics

End-to-end analytical project simulating a real-world retail banking environment, focused on customer value, revenue concentration, and early risk detection.

This project demonstrates how customer-level behavioral data can be transformed into executive insights and strategic recommendations for decision-makers.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Retail banks typically face:

High revenue concentration among a small subset of customers

Limited visibility into early churn or disengagement signals

Uneven monetization across customer segments and onboarding channels

The objective was to:

Quantify customer value at scale

Identify structural revenue risks

Provide actionable insights for leadership

## 📊 Key Insights

38% of customers generate 80% of total revenue, indicating significant concentration risk

~77% of the customer base shows early risk signals, driven by inactivity or low engagement

Branch-acquired customers generate higher annual revenue per customer than digital-acquired customers

SME customers show high activity but lower monetization, suggesting pricing or product gaps

## 🧠 Strategic Recommendations

Prioritize retention strategies for high-value customer cohorts

Improve digital channel monetization without sacrificing scale

Develop targeted engagement programs for at-risk mass customers

Reassess SME pricing and cross-sell opportunities

Implement early-warning monitoring based on behavioral signals
