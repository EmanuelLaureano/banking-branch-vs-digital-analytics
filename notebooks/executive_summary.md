# Executive Summary — Retail Banking Customer Analytics (2025)

This project analyzes a retail banking customer base to assess revenue dynamics, customer concentration, engagement risk, and channel effectiveness using annualized behavioral metrics.

## Key Findings

- The customer base comprises 7,281 active customers with an average annual revenue of approximately 1,850 per customer.

- Revenue is significantly concentrated: 38% of customers generate 80% of total revenue, increasing sensitivity to churn among high-value customers.

- 5,574 customers exhibit early risk signals related to inactivity or low engagement.

- Branch-onboarded customers generate higher revenue than digitally onboarded customers, despite digital representing a substantial portion of the base.

- SME customers show high transactional activity but comparatively lower revenue, indicating potential under-monetization.

## Business Implications

- High revenue concentration combined with widespread engagement risk creates structural exposure.

- Digital channels successfully drive acquisition but require improved monetization strategies.

- SME and Mass segments offer opportunities for revenue uplift through pricing and product optimization.

## Strategic Recommendations

- Prioritize retention strategies for top-revenue customers.

- Enhance digital post-onboarding engagement to improve lifetime value.

- Reassess SME monetization models.

- Deploy early-warning indicators to proactively manage customer risk.

This project demonstrates how customer-level behavioral analytics can directly inform strategic decisions in financial services.
